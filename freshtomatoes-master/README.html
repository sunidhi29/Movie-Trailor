<h2>DIRECTORY STRUCTURE</h2>
<p>The Movie_Trailer_Site folder consists of 3 files :</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>media.py :</strong> It consists of the class <strong>Movie</strong> in which we define 2 functions, the <strong>'__init__'</strong> function and the <strong>'show_trailer' </strong> function.The __init__ function is used to initialise pieces of info like title,storyline etc.The show_trailer function makes use of the open function defined inside webbrowser module to open the youtube trailer of the movie whose instance is used to call this method.</li><br>>
	<li><strong>fresh_tomatoes.py :</strong> This file has a function <strong>'open_movies_page'</strong>.This function takes in a list of movies as input,and as 	output it creates and opens an html page or a website that shows the movies that we gave it in the another file,entertainment.py</li><br>
	<li><strong>entertainment.py :</strong> In this file we import the above two files- fresh_tomatoes.py and media.py .We create our movie instances like toy_story,avatar etc At the end of this file,we call the function <strong>'open_movies_page'</strong> defined inside the file fresh_tomatoes.py .In this function , we pass an array of movies(instances) that we created as arguments.When we run this program , we get our Movie trailer website.</li>
</ul> <br><br>
